 * built by [DashboardDocument]; read its doc first, it carries the security
 * model. This file is the Android half: the settings that make the WebView the
 * equivalent of the web client's `sandbox="allow-scripts"` iframe, and the
 * navigation refusal that keeps the page from replacing itself.
 *
 * `javaScriptEnabled = true` is required — the bridge is a script. Everything
