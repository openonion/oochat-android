 * ── The app's type ladder ────────────────────────────────────────────────

 * use its role verbatim — don't pass a `fontSize` override, and don't reach
 * for a neighbouring role because a particular screen "looks better" a step
 * up or down. If a level genuinely doesn't exist here yet, add it here first.
 *
 *   headlineLarge  32  Unused. Reserved as the top of the ladder — nothing on
 *                      any screen currently outranks headlineMedium.
 *   headlineMedium 28  The splash wordmark and the account balance figure.
 *   titleLarge     22  Bottom-sheet titles; BackTopAppBar screen titles (M3
 *                      TopAppBar default). ChatTopBar is the one exception —
 *                      its title stacks over a status line, see its comment.
 *   titleMedium    16  Card titles in a list (agent cards), drawer wordmark
 *   titleSmall     14  Centred state titles (empty / error / success) and
 *                      warning-card headings
 *   bodyLarge      16  Settings/choice row labels; screen lead paragraph
 *   bodyMedium     14  Default body copy; sheet body; nav rows
 *   bodySmall      12  Secondary/supporting text under a row, field, or
 *                      button; monospace tool + log output
 *   labelLarge     14  Every button and pill-toggle label; chat card titles
 *   labelMedium    12  Field labels above inputs; status-pill text
 *   labelSmall     11  Captions: timestamps, mixed-case badges, status chips,
 *                      sender labels, slider ticks
 *   sectionOverline 11 ALL-CAPS badges — SOON, RELAY/DIRECT (see above)
 *   sectionLabel   11  ALL-CAPS group headings (see above)
 *   chatBody       15  Chat message text (see above)
