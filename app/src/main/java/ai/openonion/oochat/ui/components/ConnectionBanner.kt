/**
 * Full-width status banner shown below the top bar during transient connection
 * states. Disconnected shows the same Reconnect banner as Error, since a
 * dropped/manually-disconnected session otherwise leaves the user with no way
 * back into chat. onStop avoids waiting out AgentConnection's backoff.
 * awaitingOnboardCode avoids a stuck-looking "Connecting…" for a state that
 * won't resolve on its own.
 *
 * @param connectionState Current connection state driving which banner shows
 * @param onReconnect Invoked when the user taps "Reconnect" in the failed or
 *   disconnected banner
 * @param onStop Invoked when the user taps "Stop" in the connecting banner
 * @param awaitingOnboardCode When true, shows "Waiting for verification code…"
 *   instead of the generic connecting copy
 * @param isOffline The device itself has no network, already debounced by
 *   `offlineSustainedFor` — outranks every [connectionState] banner below
 * @param modifier Optional modifier for the banner container
