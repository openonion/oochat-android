/**
 * Small color-coded connection dot — colour and pulse only, no label. Lives
 * in [ai.openonion.oochat.ui.chat.components.ChatTopBar]'s fixed
 * 64dp title row, which has no room left for a status line once the row
 * carries the title too; `ConnectionBanner` just below the bar already
 * spells out connecting/reconnecting/error in words. [contentDescription]
 * still carries the state for TalkBack, since nothing visible on that row
 * says "Connected" any more.
 *
 * Was `ConnectionStatusIndicator` (dot + text) — split apart because its one
 * caller no longer has anywhere to put the text.
 *
 * @param awaitingOnboardCode When true, the underlying socket is live and the
 *   agent has already responded — it's just gated on an invite code — so this
 *   reads as connected (green, no pulse) rather than a literal "Connecting…",
 *   which would otherwise look stuck for a state that never resolves to
 *   [ConnectionState.Connected] on its own (see [ConnectionBanner]'s
 *   `awaitingOnboardCode` for the same fix applied there).
