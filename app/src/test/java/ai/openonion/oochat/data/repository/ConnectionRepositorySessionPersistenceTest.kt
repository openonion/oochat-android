/**
 * Reproduces the "first conversation loses the whole reply on reconnect" bug.
 *
 * Every SessionStore write in ConnectionRepositoryImpl hangs off a non-null
 * `event.session` (CONNECTED at :108, OUTPUT at :155) or off the explicit
 * disconnect() path at :270. A brand-new conversation hits none of them: the
 * server's CONNECTED for a fresh session carries `session_id` but no `session`
 * body, mid-turn state arrives as `session_sync` (which the repository doesn't
 * persist at all), and the agent-switch teardown inside connect() calls
 * AgentConnection.disconnect() directly, bypassing :270. The sessionId is
 * therefore never written, the next attempt connects with sessionId=null, and
 * the server orphans the in-flight reply.
 *
 * Every frame here is delivered exactly once. ConnectionRepositoryImpl.connect()
 * does not return until its collector is subscribed to `conn.events`, so a frame
 * fed afterwards cannot be dropped by the replay=0 bus; re-sending until
 * something sticks would only hide a regression in that guarantee.
